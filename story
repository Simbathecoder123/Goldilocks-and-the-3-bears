Goldilocks was a curious girl who was wondering through the woods.
She came across a cabin and she was hungry. She went inside and saw 3 bowls of porridge.
The first one was too hot and the second was too cold but the third was just right.
After she ate she was feeling tired so she went to the bedroom.
The first bed was too hard, the second was too hard but the third was just right.
The End
